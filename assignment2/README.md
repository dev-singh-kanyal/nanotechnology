### Describe the working principle of Atomic Force Microscopy

>**Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):** Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique used for imaging and analyzing the surfaces of materials at the nanoscale. Its working principle involves meticulous measurement of forces between a sharp tip and a sample surface as the tip scans across. At the core of AFM lies a cantilever, a minute beam attached to the tip that bends in response to encountered forces. The deflection of the cantilever is tracked via a laser beam, forming the basis for generating a three-dimensional image of the surface.

>AFM operates in three primary modes:

>**1. Contact Mode:**
In this mode, the tip maintains continuous contact with the surface during scanning. While suitable for imaging hard and smooth surfaces, it may pose a risk of damaging softer samples.

>**2. Non-contact Mode:**
Here, the tip hovers above the surface, oscillating but not making physical contact. Ideal for imaging soft samples, it sacrifices some resolution compared to contact mode.

>**3. Tapping Mode:**
A variation of non-contact mode, tapping mode involves the gentle tapping of the tip onto the surface during scanning. This mode minimizes damage, making it suitable for delicate samples.

>The applications of AFM span various domains:

>- **Imaging:** AFM excels in imaging diverse surfaces, from biological specimens to semiconductors and polymers.

>- **Material Characterization:** AFM is instrumental in measuring material properties like surface roughness, adhesion, and elasticity.

>- **Material Manipulation:** At the nanoscale, AFM can manipulate materials, facilitating tasks such as patterning surfaces and assembling nanostructures.

>In essence, AFM operates by leveraging the interaction forces between the tip and sample, maintaining a constant force through a feedback control system. This system adjusts the tip's height to enable scanning and generate detailed topographical images.

### Explain the features of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy

>**Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM):** Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) has redefined our ability to explore surfaces at the atomic level. Introduced in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich, STM relies on the quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunneling, allowing electrons to traverse barriers that classical physics would deem impenetrable. Here are the key features that make STM an indispensable tool in nanotechnology and materials science:

>**1. Atomic Resolution:** STM achieves unparalleled resolution, enabling the visualization of individual atoms on a surface. This remarkable capability arises from the quantum tunneling effect, where electrons can escape from a sharp tip to reach the sample surface, even across minute distances.

>**2. Real-Space Imaging:** Unlike techniques such as electron microscopy, STM provides real-space images that directly map the spatial arrangement of atoms on a surface. This offers a unique advantage in understanding the three-dimensional structure of materials.

>**3. Direct Measurement of Electronic Properties:** STM not only images surface topography but also provides insights into the electronic properties of the sample. By measuring tunneling current, it can probe local electron density and map surface potential, offering a comprehensive view of material characteristics.

>**4. Versatility for Various Samples:** STM is versatile and can be applied to image a wide range of samples, including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and even biological molecules. This adaptability makes it a valuable tool across diverse scientific disciplines.

>**5. Non-Destructive Imaging:** STM is a non-destructive technique, preserving the integrity of the sample during imaging. This feature is crucial for studying delicate materials and structures without altering their properties.

>**6. High Sensitivity:** STM exhibits high sensitivity to changes in surface topography and electronic properties. This attribute enables the detection of subtle features and variations on the surface, providing detailed information.

>**7. Nanoscale Manipulation:** Beyond imaging, STM allows for the manipulation of materials at the nanoscale. By controlling the tip position and voltage, researchers can induce local changes in surface structure and electronic properties.

>**8. In Situ Measurements:** STM can perform measurements under various conditions, including different temperatures, pressures, and atmospheres. This in situ capability enables the study of materials in their native environments.

>**9. Combination with Other Techniques:** STM can be seamlessly integrated with other microscopy techniques, such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), to provide complementary information about the sample, enhancing the overall understanding of material properties.

>**10. Continuous Development:** STM is an actively evolving field with ongoing developments in instrumentation, techniques, and applications. This continuous progress expands the capabilities of STM, opening new frontiers in nanoscale science and technology.

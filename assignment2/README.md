### Describe the working principle of Atomic Force Microscopy

>**Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):** Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique used for imaging and analyzing the surfaces of materials at the nanoscale. Its working principle involves meticulous measurement of forces between a sharp tip and a sample surface as the tip scans across. At the core of AFM lies a cantilever, a minute beam attached to the tip that bends in response to encountered forces. The deflection of the cantilever is tracked via a laser beam, forming the basis for generating a three-dimensional image of the surface.

>AFM operates in three primary modes:

>**1. Contact Mode:**
In this mode, the tip maintains continuous contact with the surface during scanning. While suitable for imaging hard and smooth surfaces, it may pose a risk of damaging softer samples.

>**2. Non-contact Mode:**
Here, the tip hovers above the surface, oscillating but not making physical contact. Ideal for imaging soft samples, it sacrifices some resolution compared to contact mode.

>**3. Tapping Mode:**
A variation of non-contact mode, tapping mode involves the gentle tapping of the tip onto the surface during scanning. This mode minimizes damage, making it suitable for delicate samples.

>The applications of AFM span various domains:

>- **Imaging:** AFM excels in imaging diverse surfaces, from biological specimens to semiconductors and polymers.

>- **Material Characterization:** AFM is instrumental in measuring material properties like surface roughness, adhesion, and elasticity.

>- **Material Manipulation:** At the nanoscale, AFM can manipulate materials, facilitating tasks such as patterning surfaces and assembling nanostructures.

>In essence, AFM operates by leveraging the interaction forces between the tip and sample, maintaining a constant force through a feedback control system. This system adjusts the tip's height to enable scanning and generate detailed topographical images.

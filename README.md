### Describe the working-principles of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) by suitable diagrams

>**Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):**

>CVD is a technique for depositing thin films on a substrate through a chemical reaction of gaseous precursors. The process involves several steps:

>1. **Precursor Delivery:**
   Gaseous precursors containing the desired materials, such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or trimethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3), are introduced into a reaction chamber.

>2. **Chemical Reaction:**
   Within the reaction chamber, the precursors undergo a chemical reaction, often at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of a solid material or thin film.

>3. **Film Deposition:**
   The reaction by-products are removed, and the desired material is deposited onto the substrate, forming a thin film. The entire process includes source gas preparation, transport to the substrate, reaction with the substrate, and removal of reaction byproducts.

>**Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD):**

>PVD is a method for depositing thin films through the physical transport of material from a solid source to a substrate. The process can be broken down into three main steps:

>1. **Source Material Evaporation:**
   The source material, typically a solid, undergoes evaporation or sputtering into a vapor phase. This can be achieved through methods such as thermal evaporation or sputtering.

>2. **Vapor Transport:**
   The vaporized material is transported through a vacuum to the substrate. The substrate is usually at a lower pressure compared to the source material.

>3. **Film Formation:**
   The vapor condenses on the substrate surface, forming a thin film as the material loses energy and returns to a solid state.

>**Differences between CVD and PVD:**

>| Feature | CVD | PVD |
>|---|---|---|
>| Source Material | Gas or vapor | Solid |
>| Deposition Process | Chemical reaction | Physical vaporization |
>| Film Thickness | Can be very thick | Typically thin |
>| Film Uniformity | Can be very uniform | Can be less uniform |
>| Applications | Wide variety of materials | Semiconductors, insulators, conductors, dielectrics |

>In summary, CVD and PVD are versatile and powerful techniques used to deposit thin films with a wide range of properties. While CVD relies on chemical reactions in the gaseous phase, PVD involves the physical transport of material in a vapor phase from a solid source to the substrate. Understanding these processes is crucial in various applications, including the fabrication of semiconductors, insulators, conductors, and dielectrics.

### Describe the working principles of Spin Coating and Lithography

>**Spin Coating working principle:**

>1. **Substrate Preparation:**
   The substrate, typically a silicon wafer or glass, undergoes thorough cleaning and preparation for the thin film deposition.

>2. **Coating Solution Application:**
   A liquid coating solution, often a polymer or photoresist, is dispensed onto the center of a spinning substrate.

>3. **Rotation:**
   The substrate is set into rapid rotation, generating centrifugal force that spreads the liquid uniformly across the substrate surface, forming a thin, even film.

>4. **Evaporation:**
   As the substrate continues to spin, excess solvent from the coating solution evaporates, leaving behind a precisely coated layer.

>5. **Film Thickness Control:**
   Factors such as the viscosity of the coating solution, spin speed, and spin time are controlled to achieve the desired thickness of the deposited film.

>**Lithography working principle:**

>1. **Substrate Coating:**
   A thin film, often a photoresist, is applied to the substrate using techniques like spin coating.

>2. **Exposure to Light:**
   The coated substrate is exposed to light through a photomask. The photomask contains a pattern that is transferred to the photoresist.

>3. **Photochemical Reaction:**
   The exposed photoresist undergoes a photochemical reaction, leading to a change in solubility. This change makes certain areas of the photoresist more susceptible to development.

>4. **Development:**
   The substrate is developed using a chemical solution. The developer removes either the exposed or unexposed areas of the photoresist, depending on the type of photoresist used.

>5. **Pattern Transfer:**
   The developed pattern in the photoresist serves as a mask for further processes like etching or deposition, transferring the pattern to the underlying material.

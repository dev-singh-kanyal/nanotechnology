### Describe the working-principles of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) by suitable diagrams

>**Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** CVD is a technique for depositing thin films on a substrate through a chemical reaction of gaseous precursors. For example, silicon tetrachloride (Al(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is used to deposit silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and trimethylaluminum (Al(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is used to deposit aluminum (Al). The process involves several steps:

>1. **Precursor Delivery:**
   Gaseous precursors containing the desired materials, such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or trimethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3), are introduced into a reaction chamber.

>2. **Chemical Reaction:**
   Within the reaction chamber, the precursors undergo a chemical reaction, often at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of a solid material or thin film.

>3. **Film Deposition:**
   The reaction by-products are removed, and the desired material is deposited onto the substrate, forming a thin film. The entire process includes source gas preparation, transport to the substrate, reaction with the substrate, and removal of reaction byproducts.

>**Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD):** PVD is a method for depositing thin films through the physical transport of material from a solid source to a substrate. For example, silicon is used to deposit silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and aluminum is used to deposit aluminum (Al). The process can be broken down into three main steps:

>1. **Source Material Evaporation:**
   The source material, typically a solid, undergoes evaporation or sputtering into a vapor phase. This can be achieved through methods such as thermal evaporation or sputtering.

>2. **Vapor Transport:**
   The vaporized material is transported through a vacuum to the substrate. The substrate is usually at a lower pressure compared to the source material.

>3. **Film Formation:**
   The vapor condenses on the substrate surface, forming a thin film as the material loses energy and returns to a solid state.

>**Differences between CVD and PVD:**
>| Feature | CVD | PVD |
>|---|---|---|
>| Source Material | Gas or vapor | Solid |

### Describe the working principles of Wet Etching and Plasma Etching

>Etching is a process that is used to remove material from a substrate to create patterns or structures at the nanoscale level. It can create structures and patterns with nanometer precision and accuracy. Etching can also modify the physical, chemical, and electrical properties of the material, which can affect the performance and functionality of the nanodevices.

>**Wet (liquid-phase) Etching:** Wet etching is a subtractive process that uses a liquid chemical solution to remove material from a substrate. The type of chemical solution used depends on the type of material being etched. For example, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used to etch silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is used to etch aluminum (Al).

>**Working Principle:**

>1. **Substrate Preparation:**
   The substrate, often a silicon wafer, undergoes cleaning and is coated with a material like a thin film of photoresist or masking material.

>2. **Masking:**
   A mask is applied to protect specific areas of the substrate from the etching solution. This mask can be a patterned photoresist or another material resistant to the etchant.

>3. **Etchant Application:**
   The substrate is immersed in a liquid etchant solution, which selectively reacts with and removes the exposed areas of the substrate material.

>4. **Etching Reaction:**
   The etchant chemically reacts with the unprotected parts of the substrate, leading to the dissolution or removal of material.

>5. **Rinse and Cleaning:**
   After achieving the desired etching, the substrate is thoroughly rinsed and cleaned to stop the etching process and remove any residual etchant.

>**Plasma (dry) Etching:** Plasma etching is a subtractive process that uses a plasma, or ionized gas, to remove material from a substrate. The plasma is created by applying an electric field to a gas. The ions in the plasma bombard the substrate, removing material through a sputtering process.

>**Working Principle:**

>1. **Vacuum Chamber:**
   The substrate is placed in a vacuum chamber, and the chamber is evacuated to create a low-pressure environment.

>2. **Gas Introduction:**
   Reactive gases, often containing fluorine or chlorine, are introduced into the chamber. These gases form a plasma when subjected to radiofrequency (RF) energy.

>3. **Plasma Formation:**
   RF energy ionizes the gas, creating a plasma—a state where ions and electrons coexist. High-energy ions in the plasma are directed toward the substrate.

>4. **Chemical Reaction:**
   Reactive ions in the plasma chemically react with the substrate material, causing etching. Selectivity is achieved through the choice of gases and process conditions.

>5. **Etch Mask:**
   A mask, usually a patterned material on the substrate, protects specific areas from the plasma, defining the pattern to be etched.

>6. **Evacuation and Cleaning:**
   Once desired etching is achieved, the chamber is evacuated, and the substrate is cleaned to remove any remaining by-products.

>**Differences between Wet Etching and Plasma Etching:**
>| Feature | Wet Etching | Plasma Etching |
>|---|---|---|
>| Etching medium | Liquid chemical solution | Plasma, or ionized gas |
>| Material removal mechanism | Chemical dissolution | Physical sputtering |
>| Selectivity | Can be less selective | Can be highly selective |
>| Anisotropy | Can be isotropic or anisotropic | Can be highly anisotropic |
>| Applications | Widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and other nanodevices | Widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and other nanodevices |

### Describe the working-principle of Atomic Layer Deposition

>**Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD):** Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique that uses alternating cycles of precursor gases to deposit thin films of materials onto a substrate. The precursor gases are introduced into the reaction chamber one at a time, and they react with the surface of the substrate to form a single layer of the desired material. This process is repeated until the desired film thickness is achieved.

>**Working Principle:**

>1. **Surface Preparation:**
   The substrate is prepared and placed in a reaction chamber. The surface may undergo pre-treatment to ensure uniform deposition.

>2. **Sequential Precursor Exposure:**
   The substrate is exposed sequentially to two or more gaseous precursors. Each precursor reacts with the substrate surface in a self-limiting manner.

>3. **Purge Steps:**
   After each precursor exposure, the chamber is purged to remove any unreacted precursors and by-products. This step ensures that only a monolayer of material is deposited during each cycle.

>4. **Repeat Cycles:**
   The exposure and purge steps are repeated in cycles until the desired film thickness is achieved. ALD allows precise control over thickness at the atomic level.

>5. **Film Growth:**
   The repeated cycles result in the layer-by-layer growth of a thin film with excellent conformality and uniformity, even on complex three-dimensional structures.
